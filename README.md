# Quantum Computing Demos
Sample programs in Q#, Qiskit and equivalent C# that can be used to illustrate superposition, entanglement and interference. So far the only algorithm incluced is Deutsch-Josza. More will be added soon.

## Requirements
Set-up your environment using this [documenation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/install-overview-qdk). Visual Studio and VS uses Azure CLI to submit quantum jobs whereas Q# notebooks use a more succinct equivalent using magic keywords.
