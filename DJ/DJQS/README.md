# Deutch-Jozsa Algorithm
DJ is a quantum algorithm that exhibits an exponential speedup over classical implementation. Given n-qubits for n-number of parameters, its time complexity is *O(1)* compared to the worst case on classical implementation which is *O(2^(n-1) + 1)*. Though it has no practical application, it clearly illustrates the quantum mechanical effects of *superposition*, *interference* and *entanglement*.
